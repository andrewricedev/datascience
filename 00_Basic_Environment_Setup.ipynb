    "Anaconda is a bit of a pain to set up initially, and with recent upgrades it makes it hard to find answers to some issues. So, to streamline this a bit, we're going to use miniconda, which is gives us a python install to use as well as the conda command for package and environment management. Unlike the full Anaconda, it does not come preloaded with packages and instead lets you choose which you need via the `conda install` command."

    "**Q: Why use Anaconda in the first place? Why not just use pip and virtualenv?**\n",
    "A: Think of conda as a curated list of packages, with specific focus on the scientific computing community. When you install a package via `conda install`, instead of just installing the package (and dependencies), it will also install optimizations. Simply put, pandas installed via conda **will** run better than using pip. Do note, however, you can still use pip to install within a conda environment, and depending on the package may sometimes have to, usually for smaller modules."
